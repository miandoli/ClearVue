## Description
Global Warming Awareness, Reinvented

## How the Simulator Works
Takes in information about each state (e.g. number of cars, number of factories, etc).
Does calculations based on the user's selected percentage growth of each variable for every month for 10 years.
These calculations are passed to another script to plot the tempatures on a map of the United States.

## About the website
Our website is hosted on SpartanHost and the domain is clearvue.info
We implemented the ammap library to create charts of the United States in order to represent data
Everything was typed from scratch in HTML, CSS and Javascript besides the library
